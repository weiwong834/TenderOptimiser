Railway Infrastructure Digitalization System
Title: "Next-Generation Rail Network Monitoring and Predictive Infrastructure Management Platform"

Description:
"The National Rail Operator seeks a comprehensive digital solution for modernizing railway infrastructure monitoring and maintenance through advanced sensing, analytics, and visualization technologies. The project requires a hybrid-cloud architecture using Azure services (Azure IoT Hub, Azure Synapse Analytics), deployment of edge computing nodes with NVIDIA Jetson devices, and integration of fiber-optic sensing systems for continuous track and structural health monitoring. Software components include a React Native mobile interface for field technicians, .NET Core backend services, and TimescaleDB for high-frequency sensor data.

The system must support AI-powered defect detection using LiDAR and thermal imagery data processed via PyTorch-based deep learning models, digital twin creation with Unity 3D and BIM integration, and integration with EN 50126/50128 safety standards. Additional requirements include SCADA integration for railway electrification monitoring, deployment of onboard telemetry units for rolling stock with GSM-R and 5G connectivity, and seamless integration with asset lifecycle management platforms such as IBM Maximo.

Cybersecurity measures must adhere to IEC 62443 standards, with support for real-time alerts via Kafka streaming, role-based access control using OAuth 2.0 and Azure Active Directory, and blockchain-enabled tamper-proof logging for maintenance records. The solution should include predictive maintenance dashboards, GIS mapping of rail assets, compliance with ERA Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI), and support for multilingual user interfaces for regional deployment."

Estimated Value: 900000 SGD
